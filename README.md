# AMT Calculator

Taxes are tough. The math behind them, however, isn't. It shouldn't be this difficult to understand the financial implications of exercising stock before tax day.

For a non-web, Ruby version see [this prior project](https://github.com/at1as/AMT_Calculator).

Issues, PRs, and feedback are welcome (and encouraged ðŸ˜…)
